Text: 
	1. Define character set/mathmatical symbol unicode. 
	2. Uniformize character rectangular bounding box for different character sizes.
		Key problem is how to resemble these rectanglar components.
	3. Define character font.
	4. Handle left/central/right alignment.
	5. Define set of templates for users.
	6. Word Wrap.
	7. Display characters.
	8. Section numbering: Body/Section/SubSection/SubsubSecition (tree structure).
	9. Cross referencing: save reference in a hashmap, behaves similar as hyperlink. 
	10. Index generation: use redbalck tree to indext contents.
	11. Use 2D array of bits to represent each symbol, referred as bit-mapped representation. This approach could leads to huge documents and font library, since different sizes of the same sybol need to be individually mapped.
	12. Better apprach is to define symbols using mathematical function. Use a language that supports quadratic and cubic functions, and elementary graphics transformation (rotation, interpolation, scaling). Program parameters like: aspect ratio, font slant, stroke width
	13. Support color
	14. Output standard page description format (PDF).
