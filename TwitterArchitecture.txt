Big and small data at twitter (Jeremy Cole):
#twdata 
155 Million tweets per day, 1 Billion tweets per week.
System need to support tweet spike.

6,939 tweets per second. 460,000 new accounts per day.

Use Mysql when it works.

Use queues and asynchronously processing.

Innodb db. Gizard.

Mysql 
Bad id generation. (Snowflake tool. Non sequential, but ordered).
Distributed data storage framework (Gizzard).
Not good by itself for graphs.
Replication inefficiency sucks, lag sucks

Cassandra
Extremely high velocity writes, medium low velocity reads.
Easy cluster expansion.

Hadoop
Unstructured, very large datasets (http logs).
UDF in java.

a lot of open source projects on github.
