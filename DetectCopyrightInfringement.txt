public Set<Video> match(Set<Video> input){
	preProcessHeaders.
	StandardizeFormat. (also need to consider different compression rate, different resolution)
	categorize input(title, content) and perform match in small subset of input and target videos.
	Extract video distinguishing factors and perform match
	fuzzy match first and filter out later.
	determine similarity and define threshold
	handle false positive and false negative
	system requirement (system response, fault over, performance, concurrency)
	Signature the normalized video:
		1. Assign 0 or 1 to each frame based on whether it has more or less brightness than average.
		2. 3 bit measure of red, green, and blue intensity for each frame.
		3. Taking into account the regions on individual frame.
}

Non algorithmic approach:
	1. Let users flag videos that infringe copyright by rewarding them.
	2. Looking at meta information in the video header.
